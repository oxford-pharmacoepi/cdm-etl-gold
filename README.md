The .Net CDM Builder was initially developed by Janssen Research & Development as a tool to transform its observational databases into the OMOP Common Data Model.
You can find the original code in https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-CDMBuilder

The program is used to convert CPRD GOLD into OMOP CDM. 

Current Software version: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) Version 17.13.1

4. input database information under the setting tab in the pop-up Building Manager Window
*If you want to re-load the previous mapping profile(DB connection infomation), make sure there is ONLY ONE Settings.xml under source\org.ohdsi.cdm.presentation.builder\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows ***including any sub-folders under source\org.ohdsi.cdm.presentation.builder\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows***
5. click building tag and the start button to start the mapping. And corresponding log will be shown.
