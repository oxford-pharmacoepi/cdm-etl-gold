The .Net CDM Builder was initially developed by Janssen Research & Development as a tool to transform its observational databases into the OMOP Common Data Model.
You can find the original code in https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-CDMBuilder

The program is used to convert CPRD GOLD into OMOP CDM. 

Current Software version: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) Version 17.13.1

Set up .NET project in local
=============
1. Download [Visual Studio Setup](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false) i.e., VisualStudioSetup.exe
2. Download and install ***Visual Studio Installer*** by executing VisualStudioSetup.exe
3. Lauch ***Visual Studio Installer*** using admin role
4. Install ***Visual Studio Community 2022*** and ***.NET Desktop Development*** over Visual Studio Installer *Since v17.13.1 is not available, please install v.17.13.3

How to run
=============
After setting up an .Net project
1. Update and save ***org.ohdsi.cdm.presentation.builder/App.config*** to configure the chunk and CDM settings.
> [!NOTE]
> - ChunkSize: Number of patients processed per chunk (ideally set to 1000).
> - DegreeOfParallelism: Number of chunk processes running in parallel (ideally no more than 3).
> - CDM: CDM version (either 5.3 or 5.4.x).
> - Tablespace: Tablespace for CDM tables.
> - SourceReleaseDate: Source data cut-off date.

3. Start Debugging

4. input database information under the setting tab in the pop-up Building Manager Window

> [!NOTE]
> - server name: IP address of the server hosting the database
> - DB name: database name
> - schema name:
>      - schema where includes source data for Source Settings
>      - schema where the source data is mapped to for CDM Settings
>      - schema where contains vocabulary for Vocabulary Settings
>
> *If you want to re-load the previous mapping profile(DB connection infomation), make sure there is ONLY ONE Settings.xml under source\org.ohdsi.cdm.presentation.builder\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows ***including any sub-folders under source\org.ohdsi.cdm.presentation.builder\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows***
 
5. click building tag and the start button to start the mapping. And corresponding log will be shown.

Example:

6. When you see ** ===== Data has been mapped ===== **, it indicates that the chunking process is complete. Close the the pop-up Building Manager Window.

7. Build constrains in CDM tables by running etl_ndorms. 

> [!CAUTION]
> - The program supports resuming only the Chunking process (conversion to CDM). If you encounter any issues beforehand, please manually delete all CDM tables EXCEPT for CDM vocabulary tables and restart the mapping from scratch.
> 
> - To ensure the program exits properly, always close the pop-up Building Manager window by clicking the 'X' button in the upper right corner.
>
> - If the program hangs during the Chunking process, press the Stop button and the 'X' button in the pop-up Building Manager Window. Then, reload the mapping profile (Settings.xml) and rerun the program.
>
> - After building constraints in the CDM tables with etl_ndorms 5_build_cdm_pk_idx_fk.py, skip 6_build_cdm_era_tbl.py and run 7_count_cdm_records.py directly, since ERA tables are already created in the CPRD GOLD ETL.
